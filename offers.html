						Everybody has something that they can do for, or provide to, someone else. With Easyah, you can share your skills and resources, safe in the knowledge that the person you are helping is also working to create positive energy in the world, just like you. In return for your offer, you receive points, which let you reach out to others who are offering their skills and resources, just like you!<br/><br/>
						For someone to contact you regarding your offer, they must meet your requirements. You can require that they <br/>
						<ul>
							<li>have a certain number of <a href="points.html">points</a>, and/or, </li>
							<li>have a <a href="recommendation.html">recommendation</a> from a party you trust.</li>
						</ul>

                        <h2>What Should You Offer?</h2>
                        You should offer something you are able to do well. Or perhaps you would like the opportunity to do something more often. You could offer to do that, and then get better at it. Anything (legal)! Share what you are able, your skills and resources.<br/><br/>

						<h2>When Your Offer is Requested</h2>						
						When someone wants to request your offer, we make sure they meet the conditions you set. Then we place a hold on their points, so they can't be spent elsewhere. You will receive a message that someone has requested your offer. You have the choice to accept, or decline the request.<br/><br/>
						
						If you accept, you will then have access to the person's contact info, and they will have access to yours. The two of you make the necessary arrangements, and then, you do your thing. When you have completed your offer, you will need to mark it complete in the app. The other person confirms your offer has been completed, and then, you will receive the points you requested.<br/><br/>

						<h2>The Benefits</h2>
                        <span class="benefitIndex">1 / 4</span> - Your offer will encourage other people to do more substantial, purposeful, positive things with their time, so as to earn the <a href="points.html">points</a> they need in order to reach out to you. Even if a person never actually reaches out to you, their knowing that you have committed to be of help, is valuable, motivational, to them.<br/><br/>

                        <span class="benefitIndex">2 / 4</span> - Since a person needs points to reach out to you, and the only way they can get them is when <a href="send-a-point.html">other people show gratitude</a> to them, and slowly at that, you can be assured that points represent positive energy that has affected many people, over time. You can build with that.<br/><br/>

                        <span class="benefitIndex">3 / 4</span> - By requiring a <a href="recommendation.html">recommendation</a>, you can require a person direct their energy toward a certain purpose. When that purpose gives them the recommendation, only then are they able to reach out to you.<br/><br/>

                        <span class="benefitIndex">4 / 4</span> - You receive something valuable when you fulfill a request for your offer. You receive <a href="points.html">points</a>, which you can use to reach out to other people like yourself, who are encouraging positive energy, by offering their skills and resources.<br/><br/>
